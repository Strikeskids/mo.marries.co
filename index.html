        Do I need to be vaccinated?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. If there are medical reasons preventing you from doing so, please get a

      <div class="question">

        Because we love each other.
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        What will you be serving at the reception?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        We are combining our heritage: it will be vegetarian Lebanese food.

      </div>

      <div class="question">
        What is a post-nuptial luncheon?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It's a time for us to chat with you after the wedding festivities are over. We'll have
        games and food so that we can hang out and relax.
        <br />
        Please drop by throughout the day for as short or as long as you like. There are no set events for the luncheon.
